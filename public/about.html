          Dreamboard is our interpretation of a
          <span style="font-weight: 600">vision board</span>, which is is a
          powerful tool used for visually representing your goals. A vision
          board is a collage containing with an assortment of images and text
          that represent things you're trying to accomplish.

              style="width: 350px; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px"

          Studies have shown that displaying your goals in this type of visual
          format can actually help you achieve them. Creating a vision board can
          help you clarify, concentrate or maintain focus on your aspirations.
          It can be used as a regular reminder and motivator of where you want
          to be.
          <div class="spacer"></div>
          Vision boards can be used for both short-term and long-term goals, and
          creating one annually is a great method for establishing your New
          Year's resolutions and encouraging you to stick to them.
          <div class="spacer"></div>
          It's also a fun arts-and-crafts project that allows you to see what
          your goals would look like once you achieve them. Explore your
          creative side, and have fun with it!
